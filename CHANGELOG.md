## [0.3.4] - Unreleased

Positioning greengate as the security & supply-chain gate for the AI-coding era.

### Added
- Slopsquat / hallucinated-package guard on every install wrapper, scoring registry existence, age, adoption and source repo. HIGH blocks, MEDIUM warns.
- Dependency-confusion detection via `[supply_chain] internal_packages`.
- `greengate provenance` — AI vs human authorship split for a commit range, with `--max-ai-lines-pct` and `--format text|json|sarif`.
- CI `advisories` job running `cargo audit --deny warnings`.
- Lint policy in `Cargo.toml` (`[lints]`) and `overflow-checks` in the release profile.

### Security
- Patched RUSTSEC-2026-0285 — `rustls` 0.23.37 → 0.23.45, `rustls-webpki` 0.103.13 → 0.103.15.
- An unparseable `.greengate.toml` is now a hard error instead of a silent fall back to defaults. A missing config still yields defaults.
- Unknown config keys are rejected (`deny_unknown_fields`) rather than ignored.
- Supply-chain signals that could not be verified now report MEDIUM instead of passing as LOW.
- Package names are validated and percent-encoded before reaching a registry URL.
- Response bodies capped at 8 MB; all outbound requests now have timeouts (10 s connect, 30 s read/write, 60 s overall).
- Crate contains no `unsafe`, enforced by `unsafe_code = "forbid"`.

### Fixed
- Two panics in `scan --triage` — source-context slicing past end of file, and LLM response parsing with reversed braces. Both covered by regression tests.
- Mutex poisoning in `watch-install` no longer aborts the run.

### Changed
- All outbound HTTP goes through one shared, pooled agent (`src/utils/http.rs`).
- `config::load` / `config::load_silent` return `Result<Config>`. Internal only; no CLI change.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed
- Broken install — release asset names in the README and composite action did not match published binaries, so every documented install path 404'd.
- Vulnerable dependencies — `anyhow` 1.0.104 and `crossbeam-epoch` 0.9.20, resolving RUSTSEC-2026-0190 and RUSTSEC-2026-0204.

### Added
- `--version` / `-V` flag.
- Three secret-scan precision filters (example-credential allowlist, entropy-noise recognizers, PEM key-body suppression): precision 55.6% → 90.9%, recall held at 100%.
- Signed releases — keyless Sigstore `cosign sign-blob` bundles alongside each asset.
- Benchmark suite (`bench/`) scoring secret-detection precision/recall/F1.

### Changed
- README leads with the install-time supply-chain gate rather than breadth.
- `scan --fix` de-emphasized in favour of suppression and baselines.
